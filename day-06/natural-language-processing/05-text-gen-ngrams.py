'''
We started with the word "i" and generated a sequence of 10 words.
The model used the bigram dictionary to predict the next word based on the preceding word. For example:
After "i", the next word could be "love", so it picked "love".
After "love", it picked "programming", and so on.


This example uses a simple bigram model, where the text is generated word 
by word based on the immediate previous word. More complex models like trigrams 
or even higher-order N-Grams can be used for better text generation that captures 
more context.

For larger corpora or more coherent text generation, you could use more 
sophisticated models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or GPT-based models. 
However, for small-scale tasks, N-grams provide a simple and effective way to 
generate text based on observed word patterns.
