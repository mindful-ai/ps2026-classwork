'''
vector_size: The number of dimensions for the word vectors (embedding size). In this case, it's set to 50.
window: The maximum distance between the current and predicted word within a sentence.
min_count: Ignores all words with total frequency lower than this.

sg: If set to 1, it uses the Skip-gram model. If set to 0, it uses CBOW.



Vector for 'python': This is the dense vector representation of the word 'python'. 
It’s a high-dimensional vector that captures semantic meaning. 
In this example, it's a 50-dimensional vector.

Similar Words: The words 'programming', 'coding', and 'fun' are most similar to 
'python' in the vector space, meaning they have similar contexts or meanings in the 
training corpus.
